1. Modify clear.sh to represent the raw partitions on the machine.
2. run clear.sh
     Usage: clear.sh $GEMSTONE

3. startstone
4. filein the benchmark classes using oo7filein.sh.
	Usage: oo7filein.sh $GEMSTONE med3.

	The initial OO7 benchmark defined various database sizes 
	as small3, small6, ..., med3, med6, med9.
	small vs med indicated the size of the database, the digit
	at the end indicated the fannout. For multiuser benchmark
	they are going to use med3 only. Hence the first parameter
	is med3.

5. run build.sh to build the database.
     Usage: build.sh $GEMSTONE totalNumUsers numToBuildInParallel

     Each user contributes about 80 MB of data. To build a 20 GB database,
     we need to build a 250 user database.

     The building is done incrementally. One can build a 10 user database
     and then add another 100 users later.

     numToBuildInParallel determines how many topaz process try to
     build the database in parallel. Set it to equal the number of
     cpu's available on the machine.

6. run runtest.sh
     Usage: runtest.sh $GEMSTONE numUsers sleepBetweenLogins

     if numUsers is greater than the number of users allowed for a
     particular database (size), a few of the topaz processes will
     exit without doing any work.

7. run count.sh to count things like number of objects updated etc.
     modify this script to record whatever numbers you are interested
     in.

     Usage: count.sh $GEMSTONE sampleTime
     set sampleTime (seconds) to something like 30

8. the numbers are contained in UserGlobals at: #stats. Run topaz
   to look at them.
