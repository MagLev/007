This repo contains two ancient versions of GemStone/S code that implement the 007 benchmark
described in the 1983 SIGMOD paper [The 007 Benchmark](http://j.mp/xnAgyO "The 007 Benchmark") by Michael J. Carey, David J. DeWitt & Jeffrey F. Naughton, Computer Sciences Department, University of Wisconsin-Madison. Implementations for other systems are available at ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu//oo7

We're providing this repo because some of you have expressed interest in porting 007 to MagLev Ruby. This code hasn't been run in quite a while. It may not even run in GemStone/S 3.1. But at least it's better than starting from scratch.

I believe the 007-v2 directory contains the more recent version.
